      question: 'How does Taxi Wale Partners work?',
      answer:
        "Taxi Wale Partners is a smart lead-sharing platform that connects drivers with relevant booking requests. Drivers post their availability, our AI matches them with nearby passengers, and secure escrow ensures safe transactions. It's like having a personal booking assistant that works 24/7.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How are payments secured?',
      answer:
        'We use a built-in escrow system that holds payments securely until the ride is completed. This eliminates fraud and ensures both drivers and passengers are protected. All transactions are encrypted and processed through secure payment gateways with bank-grade security.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I cancel or upgrade plans anytime?',
      answer:
        "Yes! You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time. There are no long-term contracts or cancellation fees. Changes take effect immediately, and you'll only pay for the time you use each plan.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I join as a vendor or agent?',
      answer:
        "Vendors and agents can join through our custom B2B packages. Simply contact our sales team through the contact form, and we'll set up a personalized plan based on your fleet size and requirements. We offer dedicated support and advanced features for business users.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Is my data secure on the platform?',
      answer:
        'Absolutely. We use 256-bit SSL encryption, comply with data protection regulations, and never share your personal information with third parties. Your location data is only used for matching purposes and is deleted after the ride is completed.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I have technical issues?',
      answer:
        'We provide 24/7 customer support through multiple channels - in-app chat, WhatsApp, email, and phone. Premium users get priority support with faster response times. Our technical team is always ready to help resolve any issues quickly.',
